# About

<p>Hi. My name is Daniel Zhang and I'm an aspiring game developer.</p>

<p>Having graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a degree in Game Design and Interactive Media in 2025, I'd like to use this site to showcase some of the different projects I've worked on as a student as well as a couple of
things I've worked on more in a hobbyist capacity.</p>

<p>Feel free to take a look around!</p>
